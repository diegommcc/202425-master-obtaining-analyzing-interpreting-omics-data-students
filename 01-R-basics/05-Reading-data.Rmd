## Introduction 

R offers different ways to read from and write data to disk. Let's put some examples that will be needed during the course. 

**Note:** this Rmarkdown can be only run if the `projectPath` function is correctly set. You can either open the R session using the Rproject file, or manually set it. 

## Using R-base functions

These are the main functions that you will need to use, although there are other options. 

* `read.table`, `read.csv`, `read.delim` for reading tabular data.
* `readLines`, for reading lines of a text file.

These functions have an equivalent to write data in the corresponding format: 

* `write.table` for writing tabular data to text files. 
* `writeLines` for writing data line-by-line. 

Let's put some examples. First, let's create a data frame to be written to disk: 

```{r}
df.example <- data.frame(
  Sample_ID = paste0("Sample_ID_", 1:500),
  Class = sample(paste0("Class_", 1:4), 500, replace = T) %>% as.factor(),
  Num_Var_1 = rnorm(500, mean = 60, sd = 10),
  Num_Var_2 = rpois(500, lambda = 2),
  row.names = paste0("Sample_ID_", 1:500)
)
df.example %>% head()
```

Now, we can write it as a TSV/CSV. The most important thing when reading/writing data to disk is the path were the files are located. If you have opened the Rproject, the following code should work. If not, you should provide a correct path (a directory that exists). 

```{r}
if (dir.exists(file.path(projectPath, "01-R-basics", "data"))) {
  write.table(
    x = df.example, 
    file = file.path(projectPath, "01-R-basics", "data", "df-example.tsv"),
    sep = "\t"
  )  
} else {
  message("Provide a correct file path!!")
}
```

Now, there should be a tsv file in `r file.path(projectPath, "01-R-basics", "data")`. We have used the `"\t"` character as separator, but it could be any other one. 

We can check if the file exists by listing the files. 

```{r}
list.files(file.path(projectPath, "01-R-basics", "data"))
```


Let's read these data from disk and assign them to a new variable:

```{r}
if (file.exists(file.path(projectPath, "01-R-basics", "data", "df-example.tsv"))) {
  df.example.new <- read.table(
    file = file.path(projectPath, "01-R-basics", "data", "df-example.tsv"),
    sep = "\t"
  )  
} else {
  message("Provide a correct file path!!")
}
```

We can check if both datasets are the same:

```{r}
df.example %>% head()
```


```{r}
df.example.new %>% head()
```


## Using the `readr` R package

This is the `tidyverse` version of these functions. `readr`` is supposed to be faster, and offers some additional functionalities In my experience, these functions are a bit faster than the R-base ones, and I find them more intuitive. 

* `read_csv()`
* `read_tsv()`
* `read_table()`

Likewise, the packages provides with functions to write to disk as well: 

* `write_csv()`
* `write_tsv()`
* `write_delim()`

It contains more functions. Check them when you need to read/write data to disk!

### Exercise: write the equivalent code using this package to load and write the previous data frame

```{r}

```


## Using the `data.table` R package

This is the package that provides the fastest way to read rectangular data in R to my knowledge. The purpose of the package is different, though. It offers an alternative to classic data frames much more efficient. I don't usually use it, but in case you are dealing with big amounts of data, it is likely you will have to look for alternatives like this one. 

* `fread()`
* `fwrite()`

We will use them a couple of times during the course!

### Exercise: do the same with the `data.table` R package

```{r}

```


## Saving complex objects to disk

We have been saving rectangular data by writing csv files. However, imagine that I need to save non-rectangular data, such as a list, or even more complex objects such as a Seurat object (we will see what they are). R provides two ways to do so: 

* Rd files: they allow us to save all or specific variables defined in the global environment into a single file, being like a snapshot of your workspace. This may seem very handy at first, but I strongly disrecommend it. When you work with small datasets, it might not be very complex, but it rapidly escalates whenever you load big objects. 
* RDS files: they allow us to save single objects. From my view, this is the preferred option. 

### RDS files

* Use `readRDS()` to load the saved object, and `saveRDS()` to save them. 
* The object is not restored with its original name—you assign it a name when you load it.
* More flexible because it focuses on one object at a time.
* Suitable for saving objects that are meant to be shared or reused.
* Good for sharing a single dataset or object across users or systems.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Saving with saveRDS
saveRDS(my_data, "my_data.rds")

# Loading with readRDS
restored_data <- readRDS("my_data.rds")
```

#### Rd files

* Use `load()` to restore objects, `save()` to save them. 
* The objects are restored with their original names (as they were saved).
* Less portable because it relies on restoring objects with their original names.
* It’s harder to integrate into other scripts since it brings objects into the global environment.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Saving with save
save(my_data, my_model, file = "my_workspace.RData")

# Loading with load
load("my_workspace.RData")
# Now both `my_data` and `my_model` exist in the environment.
```
